In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

* understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered architectures
* understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation(BP)**
* implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
* implement **Batch Normalization** and **Layer Normalization** for training deep networks
* implement **Dropout** to regularize networks
* understand the architecture of **Convolutional Neural Networks** and get practice with training these models on data
* gain experience with a major deep learning framework, such as **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.
